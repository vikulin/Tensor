Tensor Documentation
=======================

## Motivation

Currently, the market of VoIP software is dominated by software owned by big companies and tied to central infrastructure and the Internet in order to monetize the platform and control the data flow. On the other side there a various communities (e.g. [Freifunk](https://freifunk.net/), [RiV-mesh](https://github.com/RiV-chain/RiV-mesh), ..) try to establish various kinds of decentralized networks to connect people with alternative pathways even without Internet. Common VoIP software usually does not work there. This is where Tensor can serve as a use case or even "killer" App for these networks.

## Finding Contacts

Tensor has no discovery mechanism by design. Contacts are shared via QR-Code or text blob.

## How It Connects

Tensor uses a **cryptographically secure IPv6 addressing scheme** derived from Ed25519 public keys, making it impossible to clone or spoof IP addresses. This creates a statically assigned, globally unique address for each contact.

### IPv6 Address Generation Algorithm

The address generation follows this secure process:

1. **Take Ed25519 Public Key** (32 bytes)
2. **Bitwise Invert** the entire public key
3. **Count Leading 1s** in the inverted key
4. **Extract Remaining Bits** (excluding leading 1s and first 0)
5. **Construct IPv6 Address**:
   - **Prefix**: v6Space mesh network prefix (e.g., `fc00::/7`)
   - **Address Bit**: `0` (indicates this is an address, not a prefix)
   - **Leading 1s Count**: 7 bits representing number of leading 1s (0-127)
   - **Remaining Bits**: Truncated to fit 128-bit IPv6 address

### Address Structure
```
[Prefix][0][Leading1sCount][RemainingBits...]
|------|--|---------------|------------------|
 64bit  1bit    7bits          56bits
```

### Security Properties

- **Cryptographically Secure**: Address is derived from Ed25519 public key
- **Unforgeable**: Cannot generate valid address without private key
- **Globally Unique**: Each public key maps to exactly one IPv6 address
- **Static Assignment**: Address never changes for a given public key
- **No IP Cloning**: Impossible to spoof another user's IP address

### Connection Process

1. **Contact Discovery**: User adds contact with their Ed25519 public key
2. **Address Generation**: App generates IPv6 address using IPv6 address generation algorithm
3. **Mesh Network Lookup**: v6Space mesh network routes to the generated address
4. **Direct Connection**: TCP connection established to the cryptographically derived address
5. **Encrypted Signaling**: All call signaling encrypted with contact's public key

### Network Architecture

```
Contact A (Public Key A)          Contact B (Public Key B)
        |                                    |
        |-- Generate IPv6 from Key A --------|
        |                                    |
        |-- v6Space Mesh Network ------------|
        |                                    |
        |-- Direct TCP Connection -----------|
        |                                    |
        |-- Encrypted WebRTC Call -----------|
```

This approach ensures that:
- **No Central Server** is needed for address resolution
- **No DNS** is required for contact lookup
- **No IP Conflicts** can occur between different users
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy** is maintained through key-based addressing
- **Decentralized** communication without single points of failure

## WebRTC

Tensor uses [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/), a well known library for video- and audio communication. It handles audio and video WebRTC also supports NAT traversal via ICE-Servers, but this feature has been turned off for Tensor, because it is not needed.

## Crypto

[libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium) is used for the encryption and authentication of the initial TCP/IP connection (called signalling). After that, WebRTC is establishing a UDP connection for Audio/Video data. WebRTC uses it's own encryption.

### Database

The database contains the settings and contacts. It is stored in the internal/private file store of the app. If no password is used, the database is stored in plain text.

If a password is used, it will be salted and hashed using `libsodium::crypto_pwhash`. The hash is used as key for `libsodium::crypto_secretbox_open_easy` along with a nonce. The salt and nonce are stored along with the database and changed every time the database is stored.

The database file is prefixed with a four byte version header. Currently, it is set to zero.

### Calls

Contacts identities are based on public/secret keys (ed25519). These are used to sign the WebRTC SDP offers using `libsodium::crypto_sign` and are then encrypted using `libsodium.crypto_box_seal` (X25519, XSalsa20-Poly1305) with the recipients public key (curve25519) derived from the identity key.

Every packet is prefixed with a four byte header. Currently it only contains the packet length.

The WebRTC connection itself uses its own crypto scheme.
